Just hosting a SVG graphic for people to enjoy and tinker 🎉

This came up during development of https://realms.cards/ and I wanted to share since its quite useful for people wanting custom playmats on TTS as well (or in general people who want to do playmats) - this is an SVG file of a playmat overlay that can be used on top of a hi-res graphic to make your own. 

For TTS you need to export a JPG with the exact dimensions (2556 × 1663 pixels at 300dpi) and find and replace the currently used playmat asset
